24818983	S3	Although the functions of mouse Adar2 and its biologically most important substrate gria2, encoding the GluA2 subunit of AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor, have been extensively studied, the substrates and functions of zebrafish Adar2 remain elusive.	gria2|14800	84|89	Adar2|110532	32|37	Interaction_Agent

24818983	S5	The Q/R editing of gria2a was reduced in the adar2MO and was enhanced by overexpression of Adar2, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved activity between zebrafish and mammalian Adar2 in editing the Q/R site of gria2.	Adar2|58134	91|96	gria2a|170450	19|25	Transformation

24818983	S6	To delineate the role of Q/R editing of gria2a in the developmental defects observed in the adar2MO, the Q/R editing of gria2a was specifically perturbed in the gria2aQRMO, generated by a morpholio oligonucleotide complementary to the exon complementary sequence (ECS) required for the Q/R editing.	gria2a|170450	41|47	gria2a|170450	121|127	NoRE

24820415	S3	In yeast, occupancy of GPCR Ste2 by peptide pheromone a-factor initiates signaling by releasing a stimulatory Gbg complex (Ste4-Ste18) from its inhibitory Ga subunit (Gpa1).	Ste4|854387	123|127	Ste18|853548	128|133	Complex
24820415	S4	Prolonged pathway stimulation is detrimental, and feedback mechanisms have evolved that act at the receptor level to limit the duration of signaling and stimulate recovery from pheromone-induced G1 arrest, including upregulation of the expression of an a-factor-degrading protease (Bar1), a regulator of G-protein signaling protein (Sst2) that stimulates Gpa1-GTP hydrolysis, and Gpa1 itself.

24982172	S3	MC express the IL-33 receptor IL-1 receptor-related protein ST2 at high level, and this IL-1 family cytokine both activates MC directly and primes them to respond to other proinflammatory signals.	IL-33|77125	16|21	ST2|17082	61|64	NoRE
24982172	S4	Whether IL-33 and ST2 play a role in MC survival remains to be defined.	IL-33|77125	9|14	ST2|17082	19|22	NoRE
24982172	S5	In skin-derived human MC, we found that IL-33 attenuated MC apoptosis without altering proliferation, an effect mediated principally through the antiapoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-X large (BCLXL).	IL-33|90865	41|46	BCLXL|598	194|199	NoRE
24982172	S8	To confirm an MC-intrinsic role for ST2 in vivo, we performed peritoneal transfer of WT and St2(-/-) MC.	ST2|17082	37|40	St2|17082	93|96	NoRE
24982172	S9	In St2(-/-) hosts treated with IL-33 and in WT hosts subjected to thioglycollate peritonitis, WT MC displayed a clear survival advantage over coengrafted St2(-/-) MC.	St2|17082	4|7	IL-33|77125	32|37	NoRE

24982172	S10	IL-33 blockade specifically attenuated this survival advantage, confirming IL-33 as the relevant ST2 ligand mediating MC survival in vivo.	IL-33|77125	75|80	ST2|17082	97|100	Interaction_Agent
24982172	S11	Together, these data reveal a cell-intrinsic role for the IL-33/ST2 axis in the regulation of apoptosis in MC, identifying thereby a previously unappreciated pathway supporting expansion of the MC population with inflammation.	IL-33|77125	59|64	ST2|17082	65|68	NoRE

25355947	S4	This COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex interacts with the multisubunit WASH complex, an evolutionarily conserved system, which is required for endosomal deposition of F-actin and cargo trafficking in conjunction with the retromer.	CCDC22|28952	11|17	CCDC93|54520	18|24	Complex

25384973	S1	Cdc42p-interacting protein Bem4p regulates the filamentous-growth mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.	Bem4p|855942	27|32	Cdc42p|850930	0|6	Interaction_Agent
25384973	S4	We show that the Cdc42p-interacting protein Bem4p regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that controls filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Cdc42p|850930	17|23	Bem4p|855942	44|49	Interaction_Agent
25384973	S5	Bem4p controlled the filamentous-growth pathway but not other MAPK pathways (mating or high-osmolarity glycerol response [HOG]) that also require Cdc42p and other shared components.	Bem4p|855942	0|5	Cdc42p|850930	146|152	NoRE

25384973	S8	Bem4p interacted with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Cdc24p, which functions in an autoinhibitory capacity, and was required, along with other pathway regulators, to maintain Cdc24p at polarized sites during filamentous growth.	Bem4p|855942	0|5	Cdc24p|851190	61|67	Association
